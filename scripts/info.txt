This folder contains scripts that conduct ILBUS protocol

check_iteration.py      (checks the convergence of the simulations, overlaps between windows and connectivity criterion, reports simulations to prolong)
detect_connectivity.py  (analyzes overlaps in detail and proposes extra landmarks to remove convergence problems)
get_landmarks.py        (select landmarks from pool of structures on basis of the RMSD)
GO.py                   (the main script running the ILBUS protocol)
GO-restart.py           (runs ILBUS protocol for an extra landmarks)
gro_to_plumedfiles.py   (creates input files for plumed)
join_sets-eq.py         (processes finished ILBUS run for calculation of MBAR)
mbar-lowmem.py          (calculates the MBAR on the joined set)
md_round                (placeholder for commands to run md simulation)
prepare_frames.py       (converts gromacs .gro files to pdbs for plumed RMSD calculations)
prepare.py              (prepares new iteration of ILBUS protocol)
prolong                 (placeholder for commands to prolong md simulations)
