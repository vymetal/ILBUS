* Description of files and the tree structure *

This directory contains results of the simulations and input files that were used to set them. Unnecesary output files files were omitted for limited capacity of the storage.

./103-1        (ILBUS simulation with 103 landmarks)
./104-1        (ILBUS simulation with 104 landmarks)
./208-1        (ILBUS simulation with 208 landmarks)
./29-1         (ILBUS simulation with 29 landmarks)
./34-1         (ILBUS simulation with 34 landmarks)
./57-1         (ILBUS simulation with 57 landmarks)
./60-1         (ILBUS simulation with 60 landmarks)
./ad-traj      (Standard MD (10ns) for generation of landmarks)
./benchmark-md (Very long (5us) standard MD simulation)
./common       (Common files for MD used in all simulations)

1) The folders with ILBUS simulations contains other folder whose names reflect the value of force constant used in umbrella sampling.
eg. 100000 (100000 kJ.mol^-1.nm^-2)
    75000  (75000 kJ.mol^-1.nm^-2)
    56250  (56250 kJ.mol^-1.nm^-2)
    .....
File "DIRS" contains list of scheduled force constants to simulate.
File "done" lists the performed ILBUS iterations.
Folder frames contains pdb files of landmarks (atoms for rmsd calculation only)

Each ILBUS iteration folder (eg. ./104-1/100000/) involves other folders, where the individual umbrella sampling simulations were conducted. The name of the folder represent the number of the particular landmark. These simulation folders may contain these files:
COLVAR                  (plumed output file)
frame0*.gro             (landmark used as a starting configuration for simulation)
plumed.dat              (plumed input file)
state.cpt               (gromacs checkpoint, used for continuation of the simulation)
topol.tpr               (gromacs binary input file)
traj_comp.part0*.xtc    (compressed trajectory - alanine dipeptide only)

2) Content of ./ad-traj
after_eq.gro  (input configuration after equilibration)
rama.xvg      (ramachandran torsions sampled in course of the simulation)
run.mdp       (gromacs simulation setup)
topol.top     (gromacs topology)
topol.tpr     (gromacs binary input file)
traj_comp.xtc (gromacs compressed trajectory)

3) Content of ./benchmark-md
rama2.xvg     (ramachandran torsions sampled in course of the simulation)
traj_comp.xtc (gromacs compressed trajectory)

4) Content of ./common
amber14sb.ff  (force field)
ndx           (indices of atoms for RMSD calculation)
run.mdp       (gromacs simulation parameters)
topol.top     (gromacs topology)
